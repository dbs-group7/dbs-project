606331a64a8e1422542459c5,Honest Thief,"Simple and effective, this action/revenge movie races along on the most basic, primal emotions, and, thanks to the unpretentious performances, is so ""honest"" that it's easy to forgive its silliness. ",2021-03-30T14:11:50.430Z,-Sophia,0
606332424a8e1422542459c6,Centigrade      ,"Umm... of course it's ""slow"" and ""boring"", hahaha! It's a movie about people stranded in their ice-encased car! The story doesn't fit the typical entertainment flick so they couldn't go that route, obviously. Yes, some parts could've been researched a bit more (i.e. thickness of the ice/snow for light to show, fact that they didn't suffocate and prob would have in snow that thick, etc), but it's a movie and I was able to suspend my disbelief because the story held my attention.

I recommend to watch this movie thousands of time cause it is superb and cool. It made me cry but well done. Disney movie are superb and have a meaningful story in all the movies. You can make the part 2 of this movie showing what happened to Mack and ruby after they where free and have a good ending again. And the one who gave it below five star have no feelings cause they want animals to be in cage so that why they sucks and if they don't like the movie then why don't they stay in cage then they will have understand that how hard it is to stay in a cage . I would love to see the painting üé® made by Ivan and thank u Disney for making one more amazing movie and this is the best movie I have watched",2021-03-30T14:15:28.439Z,-Bill,0
