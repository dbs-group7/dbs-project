60632f134a8e1422542459c2,"[""Brendan Walsh""]",Centigrade,2019,"Thriller, Drama","Mavis Simpson, Louis Canceilmi, Genesis","A man and his pregnant wife become trapped in their car when a storm buries them underneath layers of snow and ice. As supplies dwindle and temperatures plunge, the couple must battle the elements and hypothermia in a desperate fight for survival. Umm... of course it's ""slow"" and ""boring"", hahaha! It's a movie about people stranded in their ice-encased car! The story doesn't fit the typical entertainment flick so they couldn't go that route, obviously. Yes, some parts could've been researched a bit more (i.e. thickness of the ice/snow for light to show, fact that they didn't suffocate and prob would have in snow that thick, etc), but it's a movie and I was able to suspend my disbelief because the story held my attention.

60632f8d4a8e1422542459c3,"[""Mark Williams""]",Honest Thief,2019,"Action, Thriller","Liam Neeson, Kate Walsh","Hoping to cut a deal, a professional bank robber agrees to return all the money he stole in exchange for a reduced sentence. But when two FBI agents set him up for murder, he must now go on the run to clear his name and bring them to justice. Parents need to know that Honest Thief is a Liam Neeson action/revenge movie that's much lighter and more breezily entertaining than other Neeson movies of a similar nature. It's simple, effective, and lots of fun, despite the sometimes intense violence. It's mostly comic book-style stuff, although there is a scene of a man fighting a woman and bashing her face on a hard surface; she fights back, but it's still brutal. You can also expect guns and shooting, deaths, someone being stabbed with scissors, fighting, car chases/crashes, and explosions. Gunshot wounds and cuts and scrapes are shown. Language includes ""crap,"" ""ass,"" ""pr--k,"" and a partly obscured use of ""s--t."" Two characters kiss and celebrate with wine.",2021-03-30T14:02:53.650Z,1617112973643_images (2).jpg,2,2h 5m,0
